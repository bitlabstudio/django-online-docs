- CONTAINS BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES!!
- Putting the .md into the /static/ folders was a stupid idea. They must now
  reside in the /templates/ folders. All you need to do is to move them from
  your apps' /static/online_docs/ folders into /templates/online_docs/ folders

- Added tox.ini

=== 0.3 ===

  create multilingual docs.
