- CONTAINS BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES!!
- Putting the .md into the /static/ folders was a stupid idea. They must now
  reside in the /templates/ folders. All you need to do is to move them from
  your apps' /static/online_docs/ folders into /templates/online_docs/ folders

- Added tox.ini

=== 0.3 ===

- Loading the .md files with the Django Template() class. This means you can
  use {% load i18n %} and use the {% trans %} and {% blocktrans %} tag to
  create multilingual docs.

=== 0.2 ===

- Many changes in README
- Reduced dependencies in requirements.txt
- Added project to travis-ci.org: http://travis-ci.org/#!/bitmazk/django-online-docs
- Added better test file at /online_docs/static/online_docs/online_docs_view.md
